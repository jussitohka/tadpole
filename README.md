# tadpole
Tadpole Matlab code for TohkaCiszek team (RandomForestLin)

This is uncleaned code used as a part of our submission to the Tadpole competition. It probably will be cleaned in some day. As well, I need to add some comments and instructions on how to use the code. A part of the code was written by Robert Ciszek.
